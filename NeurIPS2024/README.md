Codes for "Boundary Decomposition for Nadir Objective Vector Estimation" (NeurIPS 2024).

We use `PlatEMO v3.5` to conduct experimental studies. The problems and algorithms involved in the experiments are located in "PlatEMO\Problems\MOPs" and "PlatEMO\Algorithms\MOEAs", respectively. Files unrelated to the experiments have been removed from PlatEMO.

For guidance on using PlatEMO, refer to the manual `("manual.pdf")`. We have some remarks on the "experiment module" as follows. When running different parameters of the same problem/algorithm (e.g., a different number of problem objectives), the previous results need to be deleted/renamed/moved. For example, suppose that Algorithm A has been run on Problem B with 3 objectives. If one wants to obtain the results of A on B with 5 objectives, the results of A on B with 3 objectives should be deleted/renamed/moved before proceeding with the 5-objective experiment.
